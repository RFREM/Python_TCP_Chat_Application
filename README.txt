A Chat Application for Remote Message Exchange

This is a simple chat application designed for remote message exchange, implemented in Python. It enables users to communicate with each other through a terminal based interface.

Objectives 
	. Create the client and server components of a text chat program that uses TCP links to join one chat server and many chat clients.

Prerequisites
	. A text editor, preferably Visual Studio

To compile the application, press Start in Visual Studio. When you run the file in Visual Studio, you will get three terminals (windows). The three terminals are two clients and one server. Each terminal will specify which is which. In the server terminal, the menu displays options. There are seven options: 
1-Help 
2- Display IP Address
3- Display Port Number
4- Display Connections
5- Terminate Connection
6- Send a Message
7- Exit
In the client terminal, there are also menu options and there are six options: 1- Help
2- Display IP Address
3- Display Port Number
4- Connect to IP
5-Send Message to the Host IP
6- Exit
For the client terminal, the user must enter the IP Address first to be able to send a message; otherwise, an error message will be displayed.
